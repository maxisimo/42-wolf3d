# wolf3d
Don’t let Wolfenstein 3D’s basic graphics and violent gameplay fool you! It is in fact a
highly complex and advanced game. There is a reason why John Carmack is considered
one of the world’s best coders.
In this project you must follow in the footsteps of this brillant programmer and write
your own version of Wolfenstein 3D... Hold on, we won’t ask you to re-write not the
ENTIRE Wolfenstein 3D. One has to be be realistic here. Your mission will be to write,
using the ray casting technique, a 3D representation of a maze in which a player can find
his/her way.
Once you have achieved this goal, textures, weapons, enemies, secrets, sounds, music... The limit is your imagination.
